The project consists of the names and ages of the first 6,747 people killed in Israel's war on Gaza, read by the composited voice of several young Gazan men.

The voice is built from recordings of interviews with teenagers and young adults about their experiences of detention at the hands of the Israeli state. The interviews were conducted by Palestinian news outlets between 2007 and around 2019. The recordings were collated and pre-processed, then used as a training corpus for the creation of a single composite using the ElevenLabs speech synthesis model. Once the composite was complete, the ElevenLabs text-to-speech engine was used to produce the vocal performance.

The full recording of 6,747 names is 5 hours, 29 minutes, and 4 seconds in duration, and can be heard in its entirety by calling 0203 835 3250 from any phone. The first 20 minutes are made available on the web app.

The list covers the period 7 to 26 October 2023, and does not include the names of 281 unidentified persons killed during that time. The data was provided by the Ministry of Health of the State of Palestine. More than 26,000 people are thought to have been killed by Israeli forces during the siege of Gaza. As of February 2024, the number continues to rise.
